Copilot creates a PR with the implementation\n\n**Requirements**:\n- GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise subscription\n- Write access to the repository\n- Copilot coding agent enabled for that repo\n\n**Recent Updates (2025)**:\n- December 2025: Can assign via REST/GraphQL API\n- You're auto-added as assignee when assigning to @copilot\n- Can assign issues from issue lists and GitHub Projects\n\nLet me check if you have Copilot access on your personal account:"}

Should manage credentials upfront.
