KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
====================

14-Word Request Completeness: 60%
- Issue Template: 85% ✅
- CODEOWNERS: 70% ⚠️ (needs manual edit)
- Workflow: 35% ❌ (missing execution engine)
- README: 75% ✅
- Knowledge Base: 80% ✅

Critical Gap: Workflow execution logic not implemented
Effort to Production: 4-5 hours of developer work
Better Than 10 Words: Yes, +50% improvement
Production Ready: No (missing core functionality)

RECOMMENDATIONS
================

For 80%+ Completeness: Use 30+ word prompt
For 90%+ Completeness: Use 50+ word prompt  
For Quick Bootstrap: Link to reference architecture
For User Safety: Provide 4-5 hours contingency for implementation
