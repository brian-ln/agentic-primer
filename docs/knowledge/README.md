# Knowledge Base

This directory contains the knowledge base for the agentic-primer project. The knowledge base is git-tracked and serves as a persistent memory system for issue-driven development.

## Structure

- `architecture/` - System architecture documentation
- `workflows/` - Workflow documentation and guides
- `decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Purpose

The knowledge base serves multiple purposes:

1. **Persistent Context** - Maintain context across issues and PRs
2. **Best Practices** - Document project-specific conventions
3. **Decision History** - Track why decisions were made
4. **Onboarding** - Help new contributors understand the project

## Usage

When working on issues:
- Reference relevant knowledge base documents
- Update documents when making significant changes
- Add new documents for new patterns or decisions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
