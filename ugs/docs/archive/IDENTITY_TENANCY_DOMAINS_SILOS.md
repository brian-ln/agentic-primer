We need to be able to partition the "graph" into spaces which might overlap and to track who and what against the graph nodes.

Scenerio: BLN (human) taking notes
Remember my grocery list, and my important things to accomplish list(s), I also need a place to dump ideas for further exploration and research and noodle on things.

Scenerio: Agent (coder) coding a component
Understand clear requirements and the "model" from which to create code. tech stack, libraries, practices, where to find other info, how and when we test, how we evaluate success, what is success?

Scenerio: Me and you working together.
Me: I need you to learn how to use bun.js and be really good at it. Search the site and the code and the ecosystem. Focus on the latest version and using the modern web platform capabilities as much as possible. Use bun features before libraries. use it's test methodology and way of serving up web content, etc.
You: I need to evaluate if I understand what the user is asking for? Are they continuing the current task/activity/thread or branching off? If they are branching do I understand their goals, the deliverables they need, and the objective success criteria that will be used to evaluate the work? Are there any "subjective" things I need to be aware of? What kind of similar work have i done in the past? How is this similar/different? How should I analyze, design, and plan the work? What is the WBS? What information/skills/tools does each sub-task or tasks need? How to I evaluate success/completeness on those? How do I monitor and figure out if things are "off the rails" or "looping" or "not converging" and re-evaluate.
