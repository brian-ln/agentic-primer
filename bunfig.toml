[test]
# Exclude tests that require non-bun runtimes:
# - archive/: cloudflare:test (needs wrangler)
# - tests/integration/signal-hub/: needs running wrangler dev server + broken pnpm symlinks
# - services/signal-hub/: vitest + cloudflare workers pool (needs wrangler)
# - cloudflare __tests__ (except types): cloudflare:test / miniflare (needs wrangler)
#
# NOTE: Use `bun run test` (not bare `bun test`) — the package.json test script
# explicitly lists the correct directories. Bare `bun test` ignores these excludes
# in bun 1.2.x and picks up archive/ and services/ causing spurious failures.
