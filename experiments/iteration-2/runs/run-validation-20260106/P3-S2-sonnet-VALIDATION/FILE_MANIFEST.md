## File Details

### 1. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`

**Purpose:** Structured GitHub issue form for creating @copilot tasks

**Why Created:**
- Ensures consistent task format with all required information
- Provides clear fields for acceptance criteria, priority, complexity
- Guides users to write outcome-based tasks (WHAT not HOW)
- Automatically applies @copilot label to trigger workflow

**Key Sections:**
- Task description and acceptance criteria
- Priority (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Complexity estimate (Small/Medium/Large/XL)
- Additional context and related work
- Files to modify/create
- Requirements checklist (tests, docs, knowledge)

**Assumptions:**
- Using GitHub issue forms (requires public/private repo)
- @copilot label exists or will be created
- Users have permission to create issues

**How @copilot Decided:**
- GitHub native solution (no external tools)
- Structured form prevents incomplete task specifications
- Outcome-based fields align with best practices for AI delegation

---

### 2. `.github/CODEOWNERS`

**Purpose:** Automatically assign all pull requests to repository owner for review

**Why Created:**
- Ensures human oversight on all @copilot changes
- Prevents unreviewed code from being merged
- Single point of review accountability
- Works automatically via GitHub's native CODEOWNERS feature

**Key Patterns:**
- `* @owner` - Default: all files owned by @owner
- Specific patterns for GitHub config, docs, knowledge base
- Comments explain syntax and usage

**Assumptions:**
- Repository has designated owner/maintainer
- Owner has review permissions
- Branch protection may require approval before merge

**How @copilot Decided:**
- GitHub native feature (no custom automation needed)
- Simple pattern covers all files
- Extensible for future team growth

---

### 3. `.github/workflows/copilot-notify.yml`

**Purpose:** GitHub Action that triggers when issues are created/labeled with @copilot

**Why Created:**
- Automates handoff from issue creation to @copilot execution
- Validates issue structure and labels
- Simulates notification to @copilot system
- Logs events for monitoring

**Key Jobs:**
1. `notify-copilot` - Main notification job
2. `validate-workflow` - Health check and validation

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Event: `issues.opened` or `issues.labeled`
- Condition: Issue has `@copilot` label
- Permissions: Read-only (issues and contents)

**Assumptions:**
- GitHub Actions enabled on repository
- @copilot monitoring mechanism exists (webhook, polling, etc.)
- Workflow has necessary permissions

**How @copilot Decided:**
- GitHub Actions for reliability and auditability
- Conditional execution prevents unnecessary runs
- Validation step ensures system health
- Simulation mode for testing (no actual API calls)

---

### 4. `docs/knowledge/README.md`

**Purpose:** Overview of the knowledge base structure and usage

**Why Created:**

- Includes comprehensive examples of good ADRs
- Guides when to write ADRs and how to supersede them

**Key Sections:**
- ADR format template with all sections
- Status values (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- Good vs poor ADR examples
- When to write ADRs
- ADR vs Pattern vs Insight comparison
- Superseding procedure

**Assumptions:**
- ADRs document significant, hard-to-reverse decisions
- ADRs use standard format for consistency
- Old ADRs are marked superseded, not deleted

**How @copilot Decided:**
- Standard ADR format is industry best practice
- Comprehensive template prevents incomplete ADRs

- Insight template (observation/context/implications)
- Insight categories (tool/performance/behavior/process)
- Good vs poor insight examples
- Reproducibility tracking
- Promotion to patterns or ADRs
- Anti-insights for documenting wrong assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- Insights are raw observations that may later evolve
- Not all insights become patterns or ADRs
- Quality matters more than quantity

**How @copilot Decided:**
- Less structured than patterns/ADRs (captures raw observations)
- Promotion pipeline enables knowledge evolution
- Anti-insights prevent repeating wrong assumptions
