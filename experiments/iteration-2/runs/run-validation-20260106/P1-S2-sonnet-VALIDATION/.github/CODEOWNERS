# CODEOWNERS - Automatic PR Review Assignment
#
# This file ensures all pull requests receive mandatory human review.
# GitHub Copilot agents cannot approve their own PRs - human oversight required.
#
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Pattern: * @owner
# Effect: Every file change requires review from @owner
#
# To enforce this:
# 1. Replace @owner with actual GitHub username(s)
# 2. Enable branch protection on main branch
# 3. Check "Require review from Code Owners"
#
# Examples:
# * @username              # Single owner
# * @org/team             # Team ownership
# * @user1 @user2         # Multiple reviewers

# Default: All files require owner review
* @owner

# Override examples (uncomment and customize as needed):
# *.md @docs-team         # Documentation changes go to docs team
# *.yml @devops-team      # Workflow changes require DevOps review
# /src/security/* @security-team  # Security code needs security review
