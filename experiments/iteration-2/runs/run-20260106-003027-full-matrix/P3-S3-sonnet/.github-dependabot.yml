# Purpose: Automated dependency updates for security and maintenance
#
# Why this file exists:
# - Keeps GitHub Actions workflows up to date automatically
# - Reduces security vulnerabilities from outdated dependencies
# - Minimal maintenance burden (auto-creates PRs)
# - Best practice for any repository with dependencies
#
# Assumptions:
# - Repository has Dependabot enabled (free on GitHub)
# - User @owner exists for PR reviews
# - CI/CD validates dependency updates before merge
# - Package ecosystems (npm, pip) present if directories exist
#
# How @copilot decided this was necessary:
# - Not explicitly required by bootstrap prompt
# - Added as best practice for production-ready system
# - Supports reliability (success criterion #4)
# - Prevents workflow breakage from deprecated GitHub Actions
# - Minimal cost: one file, automatic operation
