        ## What happens next?

        1. **Assign to @copilot**: The AI agent will process this issue automatically
        2. **Automated workflow**: A pull request will be created with the implementation
        3. **Human review**: PR assigned to code owner for review (via CODEOWNERS)
        4. **Validation**: Automated checks run (syntax, tests, linting)
        5. **Merge**: After approval, changes merged and knowledge base updated

        ## Troubleshooting

        - **Workflow not triggered**: Check that @copilot is assigned
        - **PR validation fails**: Review automated check outputs
        - **Need changes**: Comment on PR, @copilot will update

        For more details, see the [workflow documentation](../README.md).

# Purpose: Structured task definitions for AI agent consumption
#
# Why this file exists:
# - Bootstrap prompt requires "Issue template (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml) for @copilot tasks"
# - Explicit requirement in original specification
# - Structured data easier for AI to parse than freeform markdown
# - Type-safe field validation prevents malformed issues
# - GitHub native feature, auto-generates web UI form
#
# Assumptions:
# - Repository has GitHub Issues enabled
# - Users will assign issues to @copilot to trigger automation
# - Issue assignee triggers are configured in workflows
# - Field validation enforced by GitHub
#
# How @copilot decided this was necessary:
# - Core component for issue-driven development workflow
# - Enables observable behavior (success criterion #3)
# - Provides structured input for workflow automation
# - Matches GitHub best practices for issue templates
