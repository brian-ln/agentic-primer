# CODEOWNERS - Automatic PR Reviewer Assignment
#
# Purpose: Ensures all pull requests receive human review before merge
# Syntax: <pattern> <owner>[@team]
# Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default owner for all files
* @owner

# Specific overrides (examples)
# /docs/ @documentation-team
# /.github/ @devops-team
# /scripts/ @automation-team

# Why this file exists:
# - Success criterion: PR auto-assignment
# - Prevents auto-merge of AI-generated code
# - Ensures human oversight on all changes
# - GitHub native feature, no plugins needed

# Assumptions:
# - Repository has a user/team named @owner
# - Branch protection requires PR reviews
# - CODEOWNERS checks enabled in branch protection rules

# How @copilot decided this was necessary:
# - Bootstrap prompt requires "CODEOWNERS (* @owner) for PR auto-assignment"
# - Explicit requirement in original specification
# - Critical for safety: AI code needs human review
