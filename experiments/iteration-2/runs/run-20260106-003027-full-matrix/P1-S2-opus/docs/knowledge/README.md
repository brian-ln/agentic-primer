# Knowledge Base

Central repository for patterns, decisions, and insights from @copilot-assisted development.

## Structure

```
knowledge/
├── patterns/    # Reusable solutions and approaches
├── decisions/   # Architecture and design decisions
└── insights/    # Observations and learnings
```

## Purpose

This knowledge base captures organizational learning from AI-assisted development:

- **Patterns**: Solutions that work well and can be reused
- **Decisions**: Why we chose specific approaches (ADR-style)
- **Insights**: Observations from @copilot interactions

## Usage

### Adding a Pattern

1. Create a new file in `patterns/`
2. Use the pattern template
3. Include context, solution, and examples

### Recording a Decision

1. Create a new file in `decisions/`
2. Use ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format
3. Include status, context, decision, and consequences

### Capturing an Insight

1. Create a new file in `insights/`
2. Describe the observation
3. Include date and context
