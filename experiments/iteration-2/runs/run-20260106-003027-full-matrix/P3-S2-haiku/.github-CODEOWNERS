# This file defines who should review changes in different parts of the codebase.
# GitHub will automatically request review from these owners when a PR is created.
#
# Format: <file_pattern> <@username|@team>
# Paths are matched from top to bottom, first match wins
#
# IMPORTANT: Replace @owner with your actual GitHub username before using!
