# Knowledge Base

This knowledge base captures patterns, decisions, and insights from @copilot-driven development.

## Purpose

The knowledge base serves as organizational memory for the project, enabling:

1. **Continuous Learning** - Capture lessons from each @copilot interaction
2. **Pattern Reuse** - Reference proven solutions for common problems
3. **Decision Traceability** - Understand why architectural choices were made

## Structure

```
docs/knowledge/
├── README.md           # This index
├── patterns/           # Reusable code patterns and solutions
├── decisions/          # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
└── insights/           # Lessons learned from development
```

## Quick Start

### Finding Solutions

1. Check `patterns/` for existing solutions to common problems
2. Review `decisions/` to understand architectural constraints
3. Browse `insights/` for lessons from similar work

### Contributing Knowledge

After completing a task, consider documenting:

- **New patterns discovered** - Add to `patterns/`
- **Architectural decisions made** - Add ADR to `decisions/`
- **Lessons learned** - Add to `insights/`

## Navigation

| Section | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [Patterns](patterns/README.md) | Reusable solutions | Looking for "how to" |
| [Decisions](decisions/README.md) | ADRs | Understanding "why" |
| [Insights](insights/README.md) | Lessons learned | Learning from experience |

## Maintenance

This knowledge base requires periodic curation:

- **Weekly:** Review new patterns for accuracy
- **Monthly:** Archive outdated decisions
- **Quarterly:** Consolidate related insights

Knowledge that is not maintained becomes misleading. When in doubt, remove rather than leave stale content.
