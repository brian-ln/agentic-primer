# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant design decisions.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a decision that affects the architecture of the system. It includes:

- The context and problem being addressed
- The decision made
- The consequences of that decision
