# Development Insights

This directory contains lessons learned, gotchas, and practical insights from completed development work.

## Purpose

Insights capture:
- **Lessons learned** from successes and failures
- **Gotchas** that caused problems
- **Best practices** discovered through experience
- **Performance findings** from optimization work
- **Team knowledge** that isn't documented elsewhere

Unlike patterns (reusable solutions) or decisions (point-in-time choices), insights are observations that improve our understanding and practice.

## Insight Format

Insights should be practical and actionable:

```markdown
# Insight Title

**Date Discovered:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** Brief description of the situation
**Source:** Issue #N, PR #M, or ad-hoc discovery

## Observation

What did we learn or discover?

## Why It Matters

Why is this important to know?

## Actionable Advice

What should we do differently based on this?

## Examples

Concrete examples that illustrate the insight.

## Related

## Insight Categories

### Technical Insights
- Performance characteristics of libraries/frameworks
- Quirks in third-party dependencies
- Platform-specific behaviors

### Process Insights
- What works well in code reviews
- Effective testing strategies
- CI/CD optimization discoveries

### Tooling Insights
- Editor/IDE configurations that boost productivity
- Debugging techniques
- Monitoring and observability practices

### Team Insights
- Communication patterns that work
- Common misunderstandings to avoid
- Knowledge gaps to address

## When to Capture an Insight

Create an insight when:
- You learn something surprising or non-obvious
- You solve a problem that took significant investigation
- You discover a better way to do something
- You find a common mistake or misconception
- Future developers would benefit from knowing this

## Index

<!-- Insights will be added here as they are discovered -->
*No insights yet. Insights will accumulate as @copilot completes tasks and learns.*
