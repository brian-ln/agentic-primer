# Solution Patterns

This directory contains reusable solution patterns discovered and validated through @copilot task completion.

## Purpose

Patterns capture proven approaches to recurring problems. They serve as:
- **Templates** for @copilot to apply in similar situations
- **Learning artifacts** that improve over time
- **Best practices** documentation for the team

## Pattern Format

Each pattern should include:

```markdown
# Pattern Name

## Context
When does this pattern apply?

## Problem
What problem does it solve?

## Solution
Step-by-step approach

## Example
Concrete implementation

## Trade-offs
Benefits and limitations

## Related Patterns
Links to similar or complementary patterns
```

## Pattern Categories

### Architecture Patterns
- Service decomposition strategies
- Data flow designs
- Integration approaches

### Code Patterns
- Error handling conventions
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### Process Patterns
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Code review workflows
- Documentation standards

## Contributing Patterns

Patterns are typically extracted from completed tasks when:
1. A solution approach works well and is reusable
2. The problem is likely to recur
3. The pattern can be abstracted from specific context

@copilot automatically suggests pattern candidates during task completion.

<!-- Patterns will be added here as they are discovered -->
