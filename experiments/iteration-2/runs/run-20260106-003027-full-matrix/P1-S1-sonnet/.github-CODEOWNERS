# CODEOWNERS - Auto-assign reviewers for pull requests
#
# When a PR modifies files matching these patterns, the specified
# users/teams are automatically requested as reviewers.
#
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default owner for all files
* @owner

# GitHub configuration files require review by repository owner
/.github/ @owner

# Knowledge base changes should be reviewed by documentation team
/docs/knowledge/ @owner

# Copilot-generated PRs (from copilot/* branches) also go to owner
# Note: CODEOWNERS applies to file paths, not branch names
# This pattern catches typical copilot-modified files
/src/ @owner
/tests/ @owner

# Configuration files require careful review
*.yml @owner
*.yaml @owner
*.json @owner
*.toml @owner

# Security-sensitive files
.env* @owner
*secret* @owner
*credentials* @owner
