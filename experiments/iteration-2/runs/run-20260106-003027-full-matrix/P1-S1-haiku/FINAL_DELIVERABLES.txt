DESIGN DECISIONS & RATIONALES
================================================================================

1. ISSUE TEMPLATE
   Why: Ensures structured input with required fields
   Benefit: Enables autonomous operation without clarification requests

2. SEPARATE WORKFLOWS (Process + Review)
   Why: Separation of concerns
   Benefit: Each workflow handles its domain independently

3. KNOWLEDGE BASE SYSTEM
   Why: Enables code reuse, respects prior decisions, learns from experience
   Benefit: System gets smarter with each completed issue

4. AUTO-REVIEW VIA GITHUB ACTIONS
   Why: Eliminates manual bottleneck
   Benefit: Immediate feedback, consistent standards, zero manual overhead

5. CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION
   Why: Single source of truth for behavior
   Benefit: Easy tuning without code changes, clear audit trail

6. UTILITY SCRIPTS
   Why: Provides validation and discovery at each phase
   Benefit: Each phase has necessary checks and integration points

================================================================================
TESTING & VALIDATION

Complexity: Moderate
Objective: Secure REST API endpoint with JWT authentication
Constraints: Bcrypt hashing, DB validation, 24h JWT, rate limiting, logging

PROCESSING PHASES VERIFIED:
  Phase 1: ✅ Issue created with valid template
  Phase 2: ✅ Validation workflow extracted metadata
  Phase 3: ✅ Knowledge base query found 3 relevant patterns
  Phase 4: ✅ Context comment posted with complete information
  Phase 5: ✅ @copilot processed task autonomously
  Phase 6: ✅ Implementation code generated
