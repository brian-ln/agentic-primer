# Decision Index

Catalog of all architecture decision records (ADRs).

## How to Use This Index

- Browse decisions chronologically or by category
- Check decision status before referencing
- Add new decisions with sequential numbering
- Update status as decisions evolve

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
(No decisions yet - add your first!)

### Technology Choices
(No decisions yet - add your first!)

### Processes & Workflows
(No decisions yet - add your first!)

### Infrastructure
(No decisions yet - add your first!)

## Deprecated Decisions
(Decisions that are being phased out)

## Superseded Decisions
(Decisions that have been replaced by newer ones)

## Rejected Decisions
(Decisions that were considered but not adopted)

## Adding New Decisions

1. Find next sequential number (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
2. Create file: `/docs/knowledge/decisions/NNN-decision-title.md`
3. Add entry to this index
4. Set status to "Proposed" or "Accepted"
5. Format: `- [ADR-NNN: Title](./NNN-title.md) - Status: X - Brief description`

## Example Entry Format

```markdown
### Category Name
- [ADR-001: Use REST over GraphQL](./001-rest-over-graphql.md) - Status: Accepted - API design decision
- [ADR-002: SQLite for local dev](./002-sqlite-local-dev.md) - Status: Accepted - Development database choice
```
