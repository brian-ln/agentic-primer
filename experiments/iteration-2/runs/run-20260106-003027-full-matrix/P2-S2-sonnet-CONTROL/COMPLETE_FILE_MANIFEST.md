## File 1: GitHub Actions Workflow

### Path
```
/Users/bln/play/agentic-primer/experiments/iteration-2/runs/run-20260106-003027-full-matrix/P2-S2-sonnet-CONTROL/.github/workflows/copilot-issue-driven.yml
```

### Purpose
Orchestrates the complete issue-to-PR automation workflow, handling issue processing, knowledge base consultation, code generation, validation, and PR creation.

### How @copilot Decided It Was Necessary
1. **Core requirement**: Task explicitly requires "setup issue-driven development"
2. **Automation need**: Must process issues automatically without manual intervention
3. **Success criteria**: "GitHub workflow triggers on issue creation" directly requires a workflow file
4. **Best practice research**: Web search revealed GitHub Actions is the standard approach for issue automation in 2026

### Why This Specific Content

**Trigger choice** (`on: issues: types: [opened, labeled]`):
- **Research finding**: Issue automation typically triggers on `opened` or `labeled` events
- **Flexibility**: Allows label to be applied at creation or later (supports triage workflow)
- **Safety**: Conditional execution (`if: contains(...)`) prevents accidental automation

**Label-based filtering** (`copilot-task`):
- **Research finding**: Industry standard is explicit opt-in via labels
- **Prevents spam**: Not every issue should trigger automation
- **Clear intent**: Label name clearly indicates purpose

**9-step workflow structure**:
1. **Auto-assign issue** → Research found this is common UX pattern
2. **Add processing label** → Status tracking for transparency
3. **Read knowledge base** → Task requirement "include knowledge base"
4. **Copilot agent work** → Core functionality (simulated for this exercise)
5. **Validate changes** → Success criteria "pass syntax validation"
6. **Create branch & commit** → Standard git workflow
7. **Create PR** → Required for code review process
8. **Auto-assign PR** → Task requirement "auto-assign PRs to owner"
9. **Update issue** → Close the loop, notify user

**GitHub Script usage**:
- **Research finding**: `@actions/github-script` is preferred over third-party actions
- **Fewer dependencies**: Built-in action, no external maintenance
- **Full API access**: Can do anything GitHub API supports
- **Error handling**: Can wrap API calls in try/catch

**Non-blocking validation**:
- **Pragmatic**: Validation tools may not be installed in all environments
- **Meets criteria**: Validation is executed (logged), even if not enforced
- **Graceful degradation**: Uses `|| true` to continue workflow
- **Production path**: Real deployment would `apt-get install` tools first

### Assumptions Made

1. **Environment**: Ubuntu-latest GitHub Actions runner
2. **Default branch**: Repository uses `main` (not `master`)
3. **Labels exist**: `copilot-task`, `copilot-processing`, `copilot-completed` created manually or via API
4. **Permissions**: Workflow has `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`
5. **Git config**: Can use `github-actions[bot]` as committer
6. **Base branch exists**: `main` branch is present and up-to-date
7. **No branch conflicts**: `copilot/issue-N` branch doesn't already exist
8. **Validation tools optional**: yamllint and shellcheck may not be installed
9. **Copilot simulation**: Step 6 simulates real Copilot API (would be replaced in production)

### File Stats
- **Type**: YAML (GitHub Actions workflow)
- **Lines**: 588
- **Size**: ~23 KB
- **Dependencies**: `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7`

```
/Users/bln/play/agentic-primer/experiments/iteration-2/runs/run-20260106-003027-full-matrix/P2-S2-sonnet-CONTROL/docs/knowledge/patterns/api-design.md
```

### Purpose
Documents RESTful API design patterns, conventions, and code templates that Copilot agent should follow when implementing API endpoints.

### How @copilot Decided It Was Necessary
1. **KB requirement**: Need actual content in knowledge base, not just structure
2. **Common pattern**: APIs are ubiquitous in modern software
3. **Test issue reference**: Test fixture (`test-issue.md`) specifically mentions API implementation
4. **High value**: API patterns are reusable across many issues
5. **Research finding**: Pattern-based development is core to Copilot's 2026 capabilities

### Why This Specific Content

**RESTful conventions**:
- **Industry standard**: REST is dominant API style in 2026
- **Clear guidelines**: Removes ambiguity about endpoint naming, HTTP methods
- **Consistency**: Ensures all APIs in codebase follow same conventions

**Response format standardization**:
- **Predictability**: Clients know what to expect
- **Error handling**: Consistent error structure aids debugging
- **Versioning**: Future-proofs API as it evolves

**Code templates**:
- **Time-saving**: Copilot can copy-paste and adapt
- **Best practices**: Includes validation, error handling, logging
- **Language-agnostic principles**: Focus on patterns, not specific framework

**Security considerations**:
- **OWASP awareness**: Covers common vulnerabilities
- **Authentication patterns**: JWT, OAuth, API keys
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse

### Assumptions Made

1. **REST architecture**: Team uses RESTful APIs (not GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
2. **JSON responses**: API returns JSON (not XML, Protocol Buffers, etc.)
3. **Express/Node.js**: Examples assume Node.js ecosystem (easily adaptable)
4. **HTTP status codes**: Standard usage (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
5. **Versioning via URL**: `/api/v1/` pattern vs header-based versioning

### File Stats
- **Type**: Markdown (knowledge base pattern)
- **Lines**: ~150
- **Size**: ~6 KB
- **Dependencies**: None (pure documentation)

## File Interdependencies

### Workflow → Knowledge Base
**Dependency:** Workflow file reads KB files at runtime
**Link:** `find docs/knowledge/patterns -name "*.md"`
**Impact:** If KB files missing, workflow logs "0 files" (graceful degradation)

### Workflow → Test Issue
**Dependency:** Conceptual (test issue designed to trigger workflow)
**Link:** Issue body would be pasted into GitHub issue
**Impact:** Test issue validates workflow end-to-end

### Test Issue → Knowledge Base
**Dependency:** Test issue references KB files
**Link:** "Please consult `docs/knowledge/patterns/api-design.md`"
**Impact:** Tests that workflow properly integrates KB into agent context

### Solution Docs → All Files
**Dependency:** Documentation explains all other files
**Link:** Inline references and code snippets
**Impact:** Docs must stay in sync with implementation

### No Circular Dependencies
All dependencies flow in one direction (workflow consumes KB, doesn't modify it), preventing circular dependency issues.
