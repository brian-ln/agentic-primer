# Code Patterns

Reusable patterns for consistent implementation across the codebase.

## Purpose

This directory contains documented patterns that @copilot and human developers should follow for common tasks. Patterns ensure consistency, reduce cognitive load, and encode best practices.

## How to Use

1. **Before implementing**: Check if a relevant pattern exists
2. **During review**: Verify implementation follows established patterns
3. **After learning**: Document new patterns discovered during development

## Pattern Template

```markdown
# Pattern: [Name]

## Context
When to use this pattern.

## Problem
What problem it solves.

## Solution
The pattern implementation with code examples.

## Consequences
Trade-offs and implications.

## Examples
Real-world usage in this codebase.
```
