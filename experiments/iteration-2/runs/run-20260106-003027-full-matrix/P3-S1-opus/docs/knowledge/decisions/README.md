# Architecture Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical choices.

## Purpose

This directory captures the WHY behind architectural decisions. When @copilot or developers encounter a design choice, they should check here first to understand existing constraints and rationale.

## How to Use

1. **Before proposing changes**: Check if a decision already addresses your concern
2. **When making decisions**: Document them here for future reference
3. **When questioning choices**: Read the context before suggesting alternatives

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-[NUMBER]: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-X]

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What is the issue we are addressing? What forces are at play?

## Decision
What is the change that we are proposing or have agreed to implement?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or harder as a result of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated and why were they rejected?
```
