# Insights

Lessons learned, gotchas, and non-obvious knowledge captured from development experience.

## Purpose

This directory preserves tribal knowledge that would otherwise be lost. These are the things you learn the hard way - edge cases, workarounds, debugging tips, and "I wish I knew this earlier" moments.

## How to Use

1. **When stuck**: Check if someone encountered this issue before
2. **After debugging**: Document what you learned for others
3. **During onboarding**: Review to accelerate learning curve

## Insight Template
