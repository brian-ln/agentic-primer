# CODEOWNERS - Auto-assignment for Pull Requests
#
# This file defines code ownership for automatic PR assignment.
# When a PR is opened, GitHub will request reviews from the matching owners.

# Format: <pattern> <owners>
# Owners can be @username, @org/team, or email

# Order matters: later rules override earlier ones for matching files
