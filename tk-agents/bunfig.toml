# Exclude Playwright tests from `bun test`
# Playwright tests should be run with `bunx playwright test`
#
# Note: bun test will automatically discover and run all *.test.ts files
# We need to exclude CONCEPT_GRAPH/tests/ which contains Playwright tests
# that use @playwright/test instead of bun:test
#
# To run only actor tests: bun test src/
# To run Playwright tests: bunx playwright test --config=CONCEPT_GRAPH/playwright.config.ts
