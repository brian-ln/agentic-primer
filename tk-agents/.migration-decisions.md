# Migration Decisions (2026-01-16)

## User Decisions on Open Questions

### 1. API Strategy: Clean Break ✓
**Decision:** System only, remove Registry completely in migration
- No backward compatibility layer
- All code updates at once
- Simpler codebase, clear migration path

### 2. Legacy Adapter: None ✓
**Decision:** No adapter at all
- Everyone must migrate
- Clean break only
- No LegacyActorAdapter wrapper

### 3. Remote Actors: Future Enhancement ✓
**Decision:** Not in scope for this migration
- Keep migration focused on semantic correctness
- Hewitt model enables remoting later without more breaking changes
- Add remote System-to-System communication as separate feature later

### 4. Version Number: 0.0.x ✓
**Decision:** This is pre-1.0 work (0.0.something)
- Early development phase
- Breaking changes acceptable
- Not yet stable API
- Will become v1.0 when stable

## Additional Clarification

**Actor Send Pattern (from user):**
- Only external code calls `system.receive()` or `system.sendTo()`
- Actors NEVER directly reference System in their code
- Actors just call `this.send(targetId, message)`
- BaseActor routes through `this.system.receive()` internally
- Like Erlang: `Pid ! Message` - just send to an address

## Implementation Directives

1. **No Registry API preservation** - remove entirely
2. **No adapter code** - clean migration only
3. **No remote actors** - future enhancement
4. **Version as 0.0.x** - early development version
5. **Follow Erlang pattern** - actors never see System in their code

## Migration Approach

Based on decisions:
- **Aggressive migration:** No backward compat, cleaner result
- **Focused scope:** Semantic correctness only, no feature additions
- **Version signaling:** 0.0.x reflects early development status
- **Clean abstractions:** Actors use `this.send()`, System is plumbing
