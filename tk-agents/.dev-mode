# Current mode explanation
reason=Pre-0.0.1.1 development phase. Breaking changes acceptable. Using git safety nets and worktrees for fast iteration.

# Mode definitions
# - aggressive: Fast iteration, breaking changes OK, use git/worktrees for safety
# - careful: Backward compatibility, migration plans, phased rollout (for post-1.0)

# When to switch to careful mode
# Switch when: public API stabilizes, users exist, post-1.0 release
# How to switch: Update mode=careful and document reason

# Current constraints
